## Overview

**XYZ** is an important project and there rest of this paragraph is simply dummy
text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
a type specimen book. 

When you do XYZ, you achieve the following: 

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

This is how xyz looks like

```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ../_static/memory_format_logo.png
  :width: 300px
  :align: center 
```

## Steps

1. Go to abc.
1. Run the following command:

   ```
   my command here
   ```
   You should see the following output:
   
   ```
   my output here
   ```  
   
1. Add the following script:

    ```
    my script here
    ```
    
You have successfully finished XYZ. Now you can do def and ghi.
